This document discusses the applicability of the QUIC transport protocol,
focusing on caveats impacting application protocol development and deployment
over QUIC. Its intended audience is designers of application protocol mappings
to QUIC, and implementors of these application protocols.

# Introduction

QUIC {{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}} is a new transport protocol currently under
development in the IETF quic working group, focusing on support of semantics as
needed for HTTP/2 {{I-D.ietf-quic-http}} such as stream-multiplexing to avoid
head-of-line blocking. Based on current deployment practices, QUIC is
encapsulated in UDP and encrypted by default. This means the version of QUIC
that is currently under development will integrate TLS 1.3 {{I-D.ietf-quic-tls}}
to encrypt all payload data and most header information.

This document provides guidance for application developers that want to use the QUIC
protocol without implementing it on their own. This includes general guidance
for application use of HTTP/2 over QUIC as well as the use of other
application layer protocols over QUIC. For specific guidance on how to
integrate HTTP/2 with QUIC, see {{I-D.ietf-quic-http}}.

In the following ssections we discuss specific caveats to QUIC's
applicability, and issues that application developers must consider when using
QUIC as a transport for their application.

## Notational Conventions

The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this document.
It's not shouting; when these words are capitalized, they have a special meaning
as defined in {{RFC2119}}.

# The Necessity of Fallback {#fallback}

QUIC uses UDP as a substrate for userspace implementation and port numbers for
NAT and middlebox traversal. While there is no evidence of widespread,
systematic disadvantage of UDP traffic compared to TCP in the Internet
{{Edeline16}}, somewhere between three {{Trammell16}} and five {{Swett16}}
percent of networks simply block UDP traffic. All applications running on top of
QUIC must therefore either be prepared to accept connectivity failure on such
networks, or be engineered to fall back to some other transport protocol. This
fallback SHOULD provide TLS 1.3 or equivalent cryptographic protection, if
available, in order to keep fallback from being exploited as a downgrade attack.
In the case of HTTP, this fallback is TLS 1.3 over TCP.

These applications must operate, perhaps with impaired functionality, in the
absence of features provided by QUIC not present in the fallback protocol. For
fallback to TLS over TCP, the most obvious difference is that TCP does not
stream multiplexing and there stream multiplex would need to be implemented in
the application layer if needed. Further, TCP by default does not support 0-RTT
session resumption. TCP Fast Open could be used, but might no be supported by
the far end or could be blocked on the network path. Note that there is some
evidence of middleboxes blocking SYN data even if TFO was successfully
negotiated. [EDITOR'S NOTE: cite Christoph Paasch's NANOG presentation here]
Moreover, while encryption (in this case TLS) is inseparable integrated with
QUIC, TLS negotiation over TCP can be blocked. In case it is RECOMMENDED to
abort the connection, allowing the application to present a suitable prompt to
the user that secure communication is unavailable.

We hope that the deployment of a proposed standard version of the QUIC protocol
will provide an incentive for these networks to permit QUIC traffic. Indeed, the
ability to treat QUIC traffic statefully as discussed in section XX of
{{I-D.kuehlewind-quic-manageability}} would remove one network management
incentive to block this traffic.

# Zero RTT: Here There Be Dragons {#zero-rtt}

QUIC provides for 0-RTT connection establishment (see section 3.2 of 
{{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}). However, data in the frames contained in the
first packet of a such a connection must be treated specially by the
application layer. Since a retransmission of these frames resulting from a
lost acknowledgment may cause the data to appear twice, either the
application-layer protocol has to be designed such that all such data is
treated as idempotent, or there must be some application-layer mechanism for
recognizing spuriously retransmitted frames and dropping them.

Applications that cannot treat data that may appear in a 0-RTT connection
establishment as idempotent MUST NOT use 0-RTT establishment.

# Stream versus Flow Multiplexing

QUIC's stream multiplexing feature allows applications to run multiple streams
over a single connection, without head-of-line blocking between streams,
associated at a point in time with a single five-tuple. Streams are
meaningful only to the application; since stream information is carried inside
QUIC's encryption boundary, no information about the stream(s) whose frames
are carried by a given packet is visible to the network.

Stream multiplexing is not intended to be used for differentiating streams in
terms of network treatment. Application traffic requiring different network
treatment SHOULD therefore be carried over different five-tuples (i.e.
multiple QUIC connections). Given QUIC's ability to send application data on
the first packet of a connection (if a previous connection to the same host
has been successfully established to provide the respective credentials), the
cost for establishing another connection are extremely low.

[EDITOR'S NOTE: For discussion: If establishing a new connection does not seem to
be sufficient, the protocol's rebinding functionality (see section 3.7 of
{{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}) could be extended to allow multiple five-tuples
to share a connection ID simultaneously, instead of sequentially.]

# Prioritization

[EDITOR'S NOTE: Is there anything to say here?]

# IANA Considerations

This document has no actions for IANA. 

# Security Considerations

See the security considerations in {{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}} and
{{I-D.ietf-quic-tls}}; the security considerations for the underlying transport
protocol are relevant for applications using QUIC, as well.

Application developers should note that any fallback they use when QUIC cannot
be used due to network blocking of UDP SHOULD guarantee the same security
properties as QUIC; if this is not possible, the connection SHOULD fail to allow
the application to explicitly handle fallback to a less-secure alternative. See
{{fallback}}.
