# Introduction

QUIC {{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}} is a new transport protocol currently under development in the IETF quic working group,
focusing on support of semantics as needed for HTTP/2 {{I-D.ietf-quic-http}} such as stream-multiplexing to avoid
head-of-line blocking.
Based on current deployment practices, QUIC is encapsulated in UDP and by default encrypted.
This means the version of QUIC that is currently under development will integrate TLS 1.3 
{{I-D.ietf-quic-tls}} to
encrypt all payload data including all header information needed for for stream-multiplexing and most on the 
other header information. Given QUIC is an end-to-end transport protocol all information in the protocol header 
is not meant to be mutable by the network and therefore will at least be integrity-protected as good as possible (if not encrypted). 

This document serves two purposes: 

1. It provides guidance for application developers that want to use the QUIC protocol without implementing it on their own.
This includes general guidance for application use of HTTP/3 over QUIC as well as the use of other application layer protocols over QUIC. For specific guidance on how to integrate HTTP/2 with quick see {{I-D.ietf-quic-http}}.

2. It provides guidance for network operation and management of QUIC traffic. This includes guidance on how to interpret and utilize information that is exposed by QUIC to the network as well as explaining requirement and assumption that the QUIC protocol design takes toward the expected network treatment. 

[EDITOR'S NOTE: This document contains notes toward a -00 revision of the QUIC
applicability and manageability statement. Write some frontmatter, then remove
this note when we have written a real draft.]

## Notational Conventions

The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this
   document.  It's not shouting; when they are capitalized, they have
   the special meaning defined in {{RFC2119}}.

# Applicability of QUIC

In the following subsections we discuss specific caveats to QUIC's
applicability, and issues that application developers must consider when using
QUIC as a transport for their application.

## The Necessity of TCP Fallback

QUIC uses UDP as a substrate for userspace implementation and port numbers for
NAT and middlebox traversal. While there is no evidence of widespread,
systematic disadvantage of UDP traffic compared to TCP {{Edeline16}},
somewhere between three {{Trammell16-RIPE}} five {{Swett16-MAPRG}} percent of
networks simply block UDP traffic. All applications running on top of QUIC
must therefore either be prepared to accept connectivity failure on such
networks, or be engineered to fall back to TLS, or TLS-equivalent crypto, over
TCP. These applications must operate, perhaps with impaired functionality, in
the absence of features provided by QUIC not present in TLS over TCP: 
The most obvious difference is that TCP does not stream multiplexing and there stream multiplex would need to be implemented in the application layer if needed. Further, TCP by default does not support 0-RTT session resumption.
TCP Fast Open can be used but might no be supported by the far end or could be blocked on the network path. Note that there is at least evidence of middleboxes blocking SYN data even if TFO was successfully negotiated.
Moreover, while encryption (in this case TLS) is inseparable integrated with QUIC, TLS negotiation over TCP can be blocked. In case it is RECOMMENDED to abort the connection.

We hope that the deployment of a proposed standard version of the QUIC
protocol will provide an incentive for these networks to permit QUIC traffic.
Indeed, the ability to treat QUIC traffic statefully as in {{statefulness}}
removes one network management incentive to block this traffic. 

## Zero RTT: Here There Be Dragons

QUIC provides for 0-RTT connection establishment (see section 3.2 of 
{{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}). However, data in the frames contained in the
first packet of a such a connection must be treated specially by the
application layer. Since a retransmission of these frames resulting from a
lost acknowledgment may cause the data to appear twice, either the
application- layer protocol has to be designed such that all such data is
treated as idempotent, or there must be some application-layer mechanism for
recognizing spuriously retransmitted frame and dropping them.

[EDITOR'S NOTE: discuss defenses against replay attacks using 0-RTT data.]

## Stream versus Flow Multiplexing

QUIC's stream multiplexing feature allows applications to run multiple streams
over a single connection, without head-of-line blocking between streams, associated at a point in time with a single five-
tuple. Streams are meaningful only to the application; since stream
information is carried inside QUIC's encryption boundary, no information about
the stream(s) whose frames are carried by a given packet is visible to the
network.

Stream multiplexing is not intended to be used for differentiating streams in
terms of network treatment. Application traffic requiring different network treatment should therefore
be carried over different five-tuples (i.e. multiple QUIC connections). Given 
QUIC's ability to send application data on the first packet of a connection 
(if a previous connection to the same host has been successfully established to
provide the respective credentials), the cost for establishing another connection are extremely low.

[EDITOR'S NOTE: For discussion: If establishing a new connection does seems to be sufficient, the protocol's rebinding functionality (see section 3.7 of {{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}) could be extended to allow
multiple five-tuples to share a connection ID simultaneously, instead of
sequentially.]

# Manageability of QUIC

This section discusses those
aspects of the QUIC transport protocol that have an impact on the design and
operation of devices that forward QUIC packets. This section is concerned
primarily with QUIC's unencrypted wire image, which we define as the
information available in the packet header in each QUIC packet, and the
dynamics of that information.

QUIC is a versioned protocol. Everything about the header format can change
except the mechanism by which a receiver can determine whether and where a
version number is present, and the meaning of the version number field itself.

The rest of this document is concerned with the public header structure of the version of the QUIC transport document that is current as of this writing.

## Version xxx QUIC Public Header Structure

in the current version of the QUIC protocol, here's what is available and when:

- version 
- connection ID (always in version negotiation and public reset, otherwise optional)
- packet number (always except version negotiation and public reset)
- flags (always, but might have different meanings, expect version flag)
- diversification nonce (wtfis????)

## Integrity Protection of the Wire Image

no meddleboxes

## Connection ID and Rebinding

a flow might change one of its IP addresses but keep the same connection ID

## Packet Numbers

note that packet numbers are monotonically increasing, but that packets
containing retransmissions as well as packets containing only acknowledgments
will get new packet numbers. Pure control and retransmission packets are
impossible to distinguish on the wire.

## Stateful Treatment of QUIC Traffic {#statefulness}

borrow from {{I-D.trammell-plus-statefulness}}. connection ID echo as
association/confirmation signal. public reset as partial one-way stop. note
that adding two-way stop as in {{I-D.trammell-plus-statefulness}} has nice
properties.

## Measuring QUIC Traffic

look at the packet numbers, gaps mean upstream loss. out-of-order always means
upstream reordering. unlike with TCP, there is no way to measure RTT
passively.

note that addition of a simple packet number echo would allow passive RTT
measurement and partial passive downstream loss/reordering measurement. packet
number echo can be sampled at the echo-side (i.e. one-in-N packets or 1/p
packets can carry an echo) for efficiency tradeoff, if necessary.

look at the connection IDs for partial tracking of mobility events.

# Open Issues in the QUIC Transport Protocol

note public reset changes for state management may be desirable.

note packet number echo for measurement may be desirable.

note that fiddly-ass packet header structures are asking for hard-to-debug trouble.
